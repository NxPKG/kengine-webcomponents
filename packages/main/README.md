| Multiple (`kengine-input`, `kengine-date-picker`, etc...) | `@kengine/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js`       | Support for using input components in forms                                                             |

### Color Palette "More Colors" Feature

```js
import "@kengine/webcomponents/dist/features/ColorPaletteMoreColors.js";
```

The `kengine-color-palette` component has a `showMoreColors` property, that, when set to `true`, enables a "More colors" dialog.
Since this is not always needed, in order to use this dialog, you must import the above feature.

### Input Suggestions Feature

```js
import "@kengine/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js";
```

The `<kengine-input>` element acts as an `<input>` with the Fiori design and added functionality, such as value state.

The so-called "input suggestions" is an advanced feature that allows the user to choose from a list of predefined options while typing.
Since input suggestions may not always be needed, they do not come as part of the `<kengine-input>` itself.

To enable the functionality, import the above module into your app. This will also automatically import `kengine-suggestion-item`
for your convenience.

### Form Support Feature

```js
import "@kengine/webcomponents/dist/features/InputElementsFormSupport.js";
```

HTML ```<form>``` only submits a couple of standard HTML elements such as `<input>` and `<textarea>` to name a few.

Web Components that function as inputs, such as KENGINE's `<kengine-input>`, `<kengine-checkbox>`, `<kengine-textarea>` are therefore
not submitted by the form out of the box.

Generally, this is not an issue, as very few modern applications submit forms in the classic way.

However, if you need to submit forms, you can import the module above, and it will enrich:
- `kengine-input`
- `kengine-textarea`
- `kengine-checkbox`
- `kengine-radio-button`
- `kengine-date-picker`
- `kengine-select`

with functionality, allowing them to be submitted in forms (provided you set their <code>name</code> attribute) just as
any standard HTML input element would be.

#### How to submit a form

There are two ways of submitting a form:
1. The `kengine-button` element will be able to submit the closest ```form``` it's placed in, provided you set its `submits` attribute.
2. Pressing Enter while a form control is focused.
(Note: ```kengine-textarea``` is the only exception. If Enter is pressed while ```kengine-textarea``` is focused, it will result in a new line).
